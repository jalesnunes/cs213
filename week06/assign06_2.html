            <h1>Academics</h1>
            <h2>Creative University education is not a narrow path that students follow from Point A to Point Z.</h2>
            <p> We encourage our students to explore the academic landscape, venturing into unfamiliar fields of
                knowledge and, perhaps,
                discovering new passions that will take them in a different direction altogether. Along the way, faculty
                members help guide them,
                and fellow students offer diverse perspectives that can shed new light on the path. We also encourage
                our students to travel literally, by going abroad for study, research, or work.
            </p>
            <p>By nurturing this spirit of inquiry, Creative aims to prepare global
                citizens who are instilled with a life-long love of learning.</p>
            <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="images/Academics/Undergraduate.jpg" alt="Undergraduate">
            <p> At Creative, we view college as a time for students to explore,
                exercise curiosity, and discover new interests and abilities.
                We provide students with an immersive, collaborative,
                and inspiring environment where they can develop a broadly informed,
                highly disciplined intellect that will help them be successful
                in whatever work they finally choose. </p>

            <p> Our students graduate with the values and knowledge they need
                to pursue meaningful work, find passion in life-long learning,
                and lead successful and purposeful lives.</p>
