            <p>Around 1672, Ferdinand Verbiest - a member of a Jesuit mission in China - built what was the first steam powered vehicle. In practice, this construction was a toy created for the Chinese emperor.</p>
            <p>In turn, automobiles with steam engines began to appear in some parts of the world only at the end of the 19th century, more specifically since the Frenchman Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot presented, between 1770 and 1771, a motorized wagon. It was a steam powered artillery tractor, which was not successful. However, this idea spread and ended up influencing the first steam car manufacturers worldwide.</p>
            <p>If, on the one hand, these vehicles require about 15 minutes of heating before being able to walk, the rest are just qualities, because everything these small locomotives could use for burning (kerosene, coal or even oil) was cheaper than gasoline , diesel or gas.</p>
            <p>At the same time, this type of vehicle could count on a typology of engines to offer a better performance, namely when starting, accelerating, climbing and even in terms of maximum speed.</p>
            <p>Por outro lado, os motores a vapor, apesar de terem uma estrutura mais “arcaica” e bruta, duravam mais, eram mais eficientes, silenciosos e recorriam a menos peças.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, steam engines, despite having a more “archaic” and gross structure, lasted longer, were more efficient, quieter and used fewer parts.</p>
            <h3><strong>Eyes on the future with the creation of the fuel cell</strong></h3>
            <p>In 1843 the first fuel cell was presented, by the British William Robert Grove. This was a lawyer, judge and renowned physicist who marked the history of the automobile for being a pioneer in fuel cell technology.</p>
            <p>This cost-effective technology was reflected in the supply and conservation of highly efficient liquid hydrogen, placed inside the fuel tanks of automobiles.</p>
            <p>This idea, despite being great for the time, was equally worrying due to the question of safety, since the cars carried with them authentic “bombs”, loaded with extremely high pressures. Putting the risk that vehicles could explode at any time, this technology was put aside in the 1960s and later recovered by NASA's North American space program.</p>
            <p>Contrary to what the vast majority of people may think, electric battery cars were a very old creation, dating back to the early days of the automotive industry. These competed against other existing technologies, such as steam-powered cars or gasoline. Most interestingly, this battle is still going on today, compared to fossil-fuel cars.</p>
            <p>As a curiosity, the first electric car was created between 1832 and 1839, by Scotsman Robert Anderson. At the same time, Ferdinand Porsche - father and creator of the Porsche brand - created the first model - in 1898 - using two electric motors placed on each of the front wheels.</p>
            <h3><strong>The “First” and modern car in the world</strong></h3>
            <img id="firstCombustionVehicle" src="/week04/images/firstCombustionVehicle.jpg" alt="first combustion vehicle">
            <p>With all this presented, it remains to be said that based on what started as a mere toy for a Chinese emperor, it ended up, over the decades, giving rise to the development of other technologies that accelerated the creation of the first combustion engine car internal gasoline.</p>
            <p>This achievement was the result of the work of the German Mechanical Engineer Karl Friedrich Benz, whose patent for the first combustion vehicle was registered on January 29, 1886. It is also important to note that this milestone in the automotive industry came to give rise to modern cars and their patent since 2011, he has resided in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.</p>
            <p>His (and ours) first car contained a single-cylinder, four-stroke, high-speed engine with 954cc displacement and a power equivalent to 0.75 hp at 400 rpm, arranged horizontally. It reached a top speed of 16 km / h.</p>
            <img id="firstEngine" src="/week04/images/firstEngine.jpg" alt="first engine">
            <p>Later, in 1913, with the contributions of Henry Ford and the first gasoline car assembly line, the cost became more democratic and led to the end of steam cars. The boilers, consisting of 260 meters of stainless steel or copper tubes, resulted in a production process that was too expensive and expensive.</p>
