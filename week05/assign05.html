            <h2>A Brief Background</h2>
            <p>Overwatch is a team-based first person shooter published and developed by Blizzard Entertainment. The two
                teams compete against each other to finish different kinds of objectives within a certain amount of time
                whilst also fighting each other.</p>
            <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/week05/images/gamePlay.png" alt="game play">
            <p>The game is often described as a “hero shooter” due to the fact that each player individually selects a
                hero to play in every match, from a roster of 30 characters. All of which are divided into three
                different categories that suit their playstyle (tank, damage and support). The game features a very
                bright and cartoon-like theme, something that makes it unique compared to other shooters.</p>
            <p>Overwatch was the winner of the awards for best game of 2016. Overwatch had around 40 million monthly
                players.</p>
            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <div id="omnic-crisis">
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Omnic Crisis</h3>
                <p>Overwatch’s story begins with the Omnica Corporation, a massive tech company which began
                    manufacturing robots known as Omnics to help aid society and the economy. They built a number of
                    state-of-the-art manufacturing plants, called Omniums, in various locations around the world. One of
                    their most popular models created was the “Bastion” unit, utilized as a “peacekeeper” and renowned
                    for its unique ability to transform between its Recon, Sentry, and Tank modes. However, after
                    multiple facilities ran into manufacturing problems and as the Omnica Corporation being investigated
                    for fraud, the Omniums were forced to shut down.</p>
                <p>Years later, multiple Omnium facilities mysteriously sprang back to life and began manufacturing
                    Bastion units with the intention of destroying humanity. They amass an army and begin their global
                    assault, starting with Russia. As a means to defend their country from the invading Omnics, Volskaya
                    Industries developed the Svyatogor, a giant human-piloted mech.</p>
                <img style="float: left;" src="/week05/images/omnicCrisis.png" alt="omnic Crisis">
                <p>As other nations were similarly invaded and attacked by the Omnics, they were forced to respond in
                    kind as well. The United States secretly began the Soldier Enhancement Program, which modified their
                    existing soldiers into elite mercenaries. The two most notable test subjects were Jack Morrison and
                    Gabriel Reyes, who will eventually become the Overwatch characters known as Soldier: 76 and Reaper,
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>Germany responded with the Crusaders, an elite force of soldiers known for their heavy suits of armor
                    inspired by knights, and large weaponry such as hammers and maces. Their forces were led by
                    Balderich von Adler and his apprentice, Reinhardt Willhelm. After a catastrophic battle in
                    Eichenwalde, von Adler falls, handing over the reigns to young Reinhardt. Von Adler’s suit of armor
                    can still be seen in the castle’s great hall.</p>
                <img style="float: right;" src="/week05/images/omnicCrisis2.png" alt="omnic Crisis">
                <p>Meanwhile on the Moon, the Horizon Lunar Colony is creating genetically modified animals as a means
                    to test long-term habitation in space. One of these, a young ape named Winston, is born. Eventually,
                    the apes began revolting against their captors, killing all of the scientists in the process.
                    Putting his genius-level intellect to use, Winston creates a rocket to escape the Moon and head to
                    Earth. A hamster named Hammond hitches a ride back, as well. The other lunar apes remained on the
                    moon, because apparently they like it there.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Rise of Overwatch</h3>
                <p>As Omnic forces continue dominating the world, the United Nations proposes the Overwatch Strike Team,
                    initially made up of Jack Morrison, Gabriel Reyes, Ana Amari (a deadly sniper from Egypt), Reinhardt
                    Wilhelm, Torbjörn Lindholm (a weapons Engineer from Sweden) and a still-unknown individual named
                    Liao, with Reyes acting as the team’s first Strike Commander. Together, they finally began achieving
                    success, pushing back Omnic forces for the first time thanks to their internationally united effort.
                    After a few years, the Omnic Crisis is declared over.</p>

                    alt="overwatch Organization">
                <p>Gabriel Reyes joins a newly formed covert organization operating under the Overwatch banner called
                    Blackwatch with other members, including Jesse McCree, Genji Shimada, and Moira O’Deorain. They are
                    deployed to fight against Talon, a new-risen terrorist threat that appears interested in starting
                    another Omnic Crisis.</p>
                <p>Reyes, along with the other members of Blackwatch, head to Italy in a covert operation to kidnap one
                    of Talon’s leaders, Antonio Bartalotti. Reyes, against his better judgment, ends up killing
                    Bartalotti, ultimately exposing Blackwatch to the world.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, another terrorist organization known as Null Sector emerges in London, comprised of Omnics
                    rebelling against society after facing persecution following the Omnic Crisis. They launch a
                    surprise attack on King’s Row, taking hostages and killing hundreds of people in the process.
                    Against the orders of the British Prime Minister, Morrison deploys Overwatch agents Tracer,
                    Reinhardt, Torbjörn, and Mercy to stop the Null Sector forces, where they are ultimately successful.

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Fall of Overwatch</h3>
                <p>Once the public became aware of Blackwatch’s extra-legal activities, an investigation is ordered by
                    the United Nations. Morrison and Reyes find themselves at odds with one another, and their argument
                    ends in an explosion at one of Overwatch’s headquarters where both men are presumed dead. Overwatch
                    is disbanded, many of its former members return home, and any further action by Overwatch is
                    considered an illegal act.</p>
                <img style="float: right;" src="/week05/images/ovewatchFall.png"
                    alt="ovewatch Fall">
                <p>In the weeks after, several former Overwatch facilities are broken into by a mysterious individual
                    who steals various weapons and equipment, including a prototype pulse rifle. The thief becomes a
                    vigilante, taking down many of Overwatch’s former enemies single-handedly, and ultimately reveals
                    himself to be Jack Morrison - who is somehow still alive - now operating under the name Soldier: 76.
                </p>
                <p>Reyes, meanwhile, also survived the explosion and, with the help of the genetic engineer Moira, is
                    brought back from the brink of death. However, the procedure leaves him, quite literally, a shadow
                    of his former self - able to temporarily render himself incorporeal. Really leaning into his new
                    goth vibe, he joins the evil Talon organization in hopes to take down the former members of
                    Overwatch and begins operating under the name Reaper.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Present Day</h3>
                <p>A second Omnic Crisis breaks out in Russia, and begins spreading across the world, which begins to
                    fall into chaos. Reaper breaks into Overwatch’s Watchpoint facility in Gibraltar and attacks Winston
                    while trying to obtain the list of all former Overwatch members, whom he plans to seek vengeance on
                    because… he’s … jealous? We aren’t 100% sure, honestly - Reaper’s past is probably the biggest grey
                    area in the OW canon.</p>
                <p>With events coming to a head, Winston issues an emergency recall to Overwatch’s agents. Tracer
                    immediately responds to his call, followed afterwards by Mercy, Genji, Torbjörn, Reinhardt, and
                    McCree.</p>

                <p>Talon agents, led by Reaper and master sniper Amélie Lacroix (AKA Widowmaker) break into a museum
                    attempting to steal a gauntlet belonging to one of their leaders, Akande Ogundimu - better known as
                    Doomfist. Tracer and Winston foil the heist, but the footage is broadcast to the world, proving not
                    only that heroes are back, but necessary during these troubling times.</p>
                <p>hat brings us to present day, where Overwatch and Talon are at war with one another, while the
                    ongoing Omnic Crisis takes place around the world. The first cinematic for Overwatch 2 reveals
                    Winston and the gang taking down a giant Omnic in Paris, and confirming in the end that Overwatch is
                    back.</p>

                <h1>Winston</h1>
                <img id="winston" src="/week05/images/winston.png" alt="winston">
                <p>A super-intelligent, genetically engineered gorilla, Winston is a brilliant scientist and a champion
                    for
                    humanity's potential.</p>

                <p>The Horizon Lunar Colony was established as a first step for humanity's renewed exploration of space.
                    Among its residents was a group of genetically enhanced gorillas that were intended to test the
                    effects
                    of prolonged habitation in space.</p>

                <p>One gorilla displayed such rapid brain development from the gene therapy that he was taken under the
                    wing
                    of Dr. Harold Winston, who taught him science and inspired him with tales of human ingenuity. The
                    young
                    gorilla passed his days assisting with the scientists' experiments, watching the distant blue world
                    outside his habitat window, dreaming of the endless possibilities that awaited him there.</p>

                <p>But his life was thrown into chaos when the other gorillas led an uprising, killed the mission
                    scientists, and claimed the colony for their own. Taking on the name of his beloved human caretaker,
                    Winston built a makeshift rocket and escaped to Earth. There he found a new home with Overwatch, an
                    organization that represented everything he had come to admire about humanity. Winston was finally
                    able
                    to live up to the heroic ideal that had been instilled in him.</p>

                <p>Now with the fall of Overwatch, Winston has gone into seclusion, once again cut off from the world he
                    believes in, but longing for the days of heroism to return.</p>

                <h1>Reinhardt</h1>
                <img id="reinhardt" src="/week05/images/reinhardt.png" alt="reinhardt">
                <p>Reinhardt Wilhelm styles himself as a champion of a bygone age, who lives by the knightly codes of
                    valor, justice, and courage.</p>

                <p>Over thirty years ago, Overwatch was founded to counter the threat of the robot uprisings around the
                    world. Reinhardt, a highly decorated German soldier, was inducted as part of the original Overwatch
                    strike team that put an end to the Omnic Crisis. After the conflict's resolution, Overwatch grew
                    into a global institution, keeping the peace in a war-torn world. Reinhardt proved himself to be one
                    of its most stalwart champions.</p>

                <p> Reinhardt's unique ethics and larger-than-life persona earned the admiration of his peers and
                    superiors alike. Never afraid to speak his mind, he was Overwatch's most vocal supporter and, when
                    necessary, its harshest critic, providing a constant reminder that Overwatch was meant to be a force
                    for good.</p>

                <p>Having served into his late fifties, Reinhardt was faced with mandatory retirement from combat
                    operations. Despondent about being removed from active duty, Reinhardt feared that his days of
                    purpose and glory had ended. As times grew darker and Overwatch came under suspicion of corruption
                    and sedition, Reinhardt could only watch as the cause he had dedicated his life to defending
                    surrendered in disgrace.</p>

                <img id="mercy" src="/week05/images/mercy.png" alt="mercy">
                <p>A guardian angel to those who come under her care, Dr. Angela Ziegler is a peerless healer, a
                    brilliant
                    scientist, and a staunch advocate for peace.</p>
                <p>Ziegler rose to become the head of surgery at a prominent Swiss hospital before pioneering a
                    breakthrough
                    in the field of applied nanobiology that radically improved the treatment of life-threatening
                    illnesses
                    and injuries. It was this expertise that attracted the attention of Overwatch.</p>

                <p>Because her parents had been taken by war, Ziegler was opposed to the organization's militaristic
                    approach to keeping global peace. Ultimately, she recognized that Overwatch offered her the
                    opportunity
                    to save lives on a much larger scale. As Overwatch's head of medical research, Angela sought to
                    leverage
                    her work for healing in frontline crises. The result was the Valkyrie swift-response suit, which
                    Ziegler
                    herself piloted on many Overwatch missions.</p>

                <p>Despite her contributions to Overwatch, she was often at odds with her superiors and the
                    organization's
                    overarching aims. When Overwatch dissolved, Ziegler dedicated herself to helping those affected by
                    war.
                </p>

                <p>Though she spends most of her time caring for the broken and dispossessed in crisis areas around the
                    world, Dr. Ziegler can be counted on to don her Valkyrie suit whenever innocents are imperiled.</p>

                <img id="mei" src="/week05/images/mei.png" alt="mei">
                <p>Mei is a scientist who has taken the fight to preserve the environment into her own hands.</p>

                <p>Though many blamed the planet's escalating, unexplained climate phenomena on the advent of new
                    technologies, the rapidly growing omnic population, and drastically increased consumption of
                    resources, the true cause remained unknown. To find a solution, Overwatch established a series of
                    eco-Watchpoints at remote, critical locations worldwide.</p>

                <p>Mei-Ling Zhou was a member of this multiyear initiative. A peerless climatologist, she had introduced
                    cutting-edge innovations in the field of climate manipulation that protected at-risk areas in Asia
                    and beyond. She was assigned to the program's monitoring station at Watchpoint: Antarctica when
                    disaster struck: a sudden, catastrophic polar storm battered the installation and cut it off from
                    the outside world, leaving the facility damaged and the scientists stranded. As their supplies
                    dwindled, they entered cryostasis in a last-ditch effort to survive until a rescue attempt could be
                    made.</p>

                <p>But that rescue never came. It was years later when the team's cryogenics chamber was finally
                    discovered. Mei, still in hibernation, was the only survivor. The world Mei awoke to had gone
                    through considerable changes: Overwatch was no more, the serious climate issues had worsened, and
                    none of the eco-Watchpoints were in operation. Any clues that they had uncovered were lost.</p>
